# This template ensures Bucket Policy Only is enabled.
# Bucket Policy Only feature allows you to uniformly control access to 
# Cloud Storage resources. When enabled on a bucket, only bucket-level 
# Cloud IAM permissions grant access to that bucket and the objects it 
# contains; Access Control Lists (ACLs) are disabled and access granted 
# by ACLs is revoked.
# For more details see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-policy-only
