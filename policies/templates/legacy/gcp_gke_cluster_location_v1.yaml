              clusters can be created, e.g. us-central1-a, us-east1. Multiple
              locations can be specified. Regions and zones need to be specified
              separately, as this allows for restricting clusters to be zonal or
              regional, e.g. whitelisting us-central1 will allow regional
              clusters to be created, but will not implicitly allow zonal
              clusters in any us-central1 zone."
