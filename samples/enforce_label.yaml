    description: Checks that labels are set for all resources (or a subset of resources)
      and that they match a certain regular expression pattern.
spec:
  severity: high
  match:
    target: ["organization/*"]
  parameters:
    # required parameter: list of label objects that resources should have.
    # A label object is composed of a key value pair like: 
    #
    #   "label_key": "label_value_regex_to_match"
    #
    # Any missing label results in a violation. For instance a resource with no label1 or label2 label,
    # in this sample case, would raise 2 violations: one for label1 being absent and one for label2.
    #
    # In the same spirit, a resource with label1 or label2 present, but with values not matching their respective regex
    # would also raise one violation per mismatch. 
    #
    # In the following example, valid values for a label named "label1" would be only "label1-value",
    # but a label named label2 could have various values like "label2-value", "label2-valueOK" etc. 
    #
    # A violation is raised if the label value does not match the pattern passed as a parameter here.
    mandatory_labels:
    - "label1": "^label1-value$"
    - "label2": "^label2-value.*$"

    # optional parameter: list of resource types to scan for labels
    # any resource that is not of these types will not raise any violation.
    # In this sample use case, only non-compliant projects and buckets would be flagged.
    # If not passed, all tested resource types would be scanned for (see template for full list)
    resource_types_to_scan:
    - "cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project"
    - "storage.googleapis.com/Bucket"
